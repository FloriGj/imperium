Imperium – Single Page E-Commerce Website
Imperium is a fully responsive, single-page e-commerce website built from scratch using PHP, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and SCSS. It features a secure login and registration system (including Google OAuth), dynamic product rendering, and a full checkout process powered by a payment API. The backend connects to a MySQL database using PDO, managed via phpMyAdmin.
